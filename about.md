## About me

I started to code when I was fourteen years old. My first programming language was <a href="http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm">pawn</a>, and I used it to create a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas multiplayer server that could be played trough <a href="https://www.sa-mp.com/">SA-MP</a>.

I studied to be a Computer Technician at the <a href="http://www.farroupilha.ifrs.edu.br/site/">Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS) in Farroupilha</a> for three years, but dropped the course in 2017 so that I could start to study Computer Science at the <a href="http://site.ufsm.br/">Federal University of Santa Maria</a>.

My first professional experience was as an intern at the Department of Educational Technologies in the <a href="http://www.educacao.rs.gov.br/cre-04-caxias-do-sul">Fourth Regional Coordination of Education (May ~ October, 2015)</a>.

In the end of 2015 I started to work at <a href="http://eleaut.com.br">ELEAUT</a>. I worked there for four years develiping .NET tools to automate workflows (specially from IT) as well as applications (both mobile and desktop) that were used by the end-customers as an interface to manage ELEAUT's products. Even though I worked as a developer, since it was a small company, I also ended up learning and doing a lot of IT stuff: from managing networks and vlans to setting up servers and infrastructure.

Currently interested in infosec. Focusing on iOS and WebKit.

## Projects

#### [Remoteflix](https://github.com/remoteflix/) (work-in-progress)
<sub>C# (WPF) and JavaScript (React Native)</sub>

Project that consists of a desktop application and a mobile one. Aims to allow the user to control media players (Netflix, VLC, Popcorn, etc.) running on their desktop/notebook from their phones through LAN (yeah, I was tired of getting up to pause VLC to take a look at my phone, so what?)

#### [SimpleDialogs](https://github.com/schdck/SimpleDialogs)
<sub>C# (WPF)</sub>

Framework for easily creating beautiful dialogs in WPF.

#### [VirtualBingo](https://github.com/schdck/VirtualBingo)
<sub>C# (WPF)</sub>

VirtualBingo ([BingoUtil's](https://github.com/schdck/BingoUtils) successor) is a application that I developed when I was working on a project tutored by Professor Dr. [Daniela de Campos](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3233244381103913). It was originally aimed at improving the teaching of History, but was adapted to provide any teacher of any subject an alternative (and hopefully more fun) way of teaching their subject.

The idea was that the teacher would add questions and answers to the software and it would generate [bingo cards](/assets/img/bingo_card.jpg) containing the answers. Later, the teacher would use the software in class to play bingo with the students: the software sorts the questions and shows them one by one. The student who has the answer the current question on their card would mark it. The first to mark all answers on his card would win.

#### [VMRHN](https://github.com/schdck/VMRHN)
<sub>PowerShell</sub>

Virtual Machine Replication Health Notifier is a _very_ simple PowerShell script to send you an e-mail when one of your Hyper-V Virtual Machines replication fail.

#### [ph0ton Admin System](https://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=477391)
<sub>PAWN</sub>

This was my first "big" project (it dates back to 2013). It is a Filter Script that could be added to a SA-MP server ir order to add admin functionalities such as banning users, saving account details, creating logs, etc.
